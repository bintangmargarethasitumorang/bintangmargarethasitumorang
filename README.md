# Hello everyone!
Let me introduce myself, my name is **Bintang Margaretha Situmorang**.

I am a 7th-semester student majoring in Information Systems at Institut Teknologi Del. Since the beginning of my studies, I have developed a strong interest in data analysis. I believe that data has great potential to provide valuable insights and support intelligent decision-making.
Throughout my academic journey, I have studied various relevant concepts and tools in data analysis, such as data collection, processing, and visualization. I also have a good understanding of programming languages such as SQL, Python, and R, as well as knowledge of databases and statistical analysis techniques.
Furthermore, I am always enthusiastic about exploring new skills and striving to enhance my understanding in this field. I am particularly fascinated by how data can provide deep insights into trends, patterns, and user behaviour that can be used to make smarter business decisions.

I am very excited and ready to take on challenges in data analysis and contribute to developing a better information world. If you want to get to know me, please follow my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bintangmargaretha/) account.
